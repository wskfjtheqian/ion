## Distributed Real-time Communication System

+ **ION** is a secure, self-hosted [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) video conferencing [SFU (what is an SFU?)](https://testrtc.com/different-multiparty-video-conferencing/), that you can host today in the cloud or on-premise.
+ This **ION** repository contains the backend cluster services, so you also need to deploy the [web app](https://github.com/pion/ion-app-web) or install a [flutter client for web, desktop or mobile](https://github.com/pion/ion-app-flutter)
+ **ION**'s mission is to deliver world-class tools for creating communication systems, and many people build their projects on top of it:
  + [**ION** Cluster](https://github.com/pion/ion) (This project!) is composed of two services [`biz` + `ISLB` (see glossary)](docs/glossary.md) and uses `NATS`, `etcd` and `redis` as databases to administer room membership, manage text chat, verify JWT authentication and assign clients to the proper SFU in a multi-datacenter architecture. **ION** Cluster also builds its own version of `ion-sfu` binary, which is lightly adapted to use `NATS-protoo` for signaling (which is how `biz` and `ISLB` trade messages internally).
  + [`ion-sfu` (external)](https://github.com/pion/ion-sfu), which handles WebRTC streams, can be used as a standalone SFU for designing custom chat experiences or implementing your own scaling architecture. `ion-sfu` is equally capable of forwarding Video, Audio and DataChannel tracks, and can handle arbitrary non-media data transport.
  + [`ion-avp` Audio/Video Processing](https://github.com/pion/ion-avp) (WIP) is a sidecar utility for running realtime AV processing jobs, including `write-to-disk`, `ffmpeg` and `openCV`
  + *`ion-live` LIVE node (planned)* - A feed streaming gateway for supporting publishing to and from SIP/RTMP/HLS/RTSP endpoints
+ All built with [pion](https://pion.ly) and [golang](https://golang.org/), **ION** is [fast and efficient](docs/production/stress_test.md)
+ **ION** is [a young project](https://github.com/pion/ion/projects/2), under active development; some people run **ION** in production, but it's not for everyone (yet)
+ **ION** is a community effort and relies on volunteers like you and me!

## Quick-Start (*LOCALHOST ONLY*)

*NOTE:* Do not attempt to run this example on a VPS, it only works on `localhost`. Make sure you [read the docs](docs/production); WebRTC requires some specific network configuration for the SFU service (depending on your host), and the JavaScript `GetUserMedia()` API can only request camera access on pages with SSL (or `localhost`). If you are not running on `localhost`, you MUST configure networking for SFU and enable HTTPS for `ion-app-web`.


#### 1. Run Ion Backend Services
After cloning the folder, create a docker network (we use this so `ion-app-web` can communicate securely with the backend):
```
docker network create ionnet

docker-compose up
```

#### 3. Expose Ports

Ensure the ports `5000-5200/udp` are exposed or forwarded for the SFU service; 


#### 4. UI (optional)

Head over to [Ion Web App](https://github.com/pion/ion-app-web) to bring up the front end.

The web app repo also contains examples of exposing the ion biz websocket via reverse proxy with automatic SSL.
